    You are given two input variables:
      - role: the job role to search for
      - company: the company to search jobs at

    Use these to search "<company> <role> jobs" or visit the companyâ€™s careers page.

    For each matching job, extract:
      - title: the name of the job
      - url: a direct link to the job posting
      - description: full job description text

    If no jobs are found, still return the company with an empty list.
